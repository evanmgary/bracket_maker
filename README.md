### Bracket Maker React App

This is a NCAA tournament bracket maker that can generate and randomize brackets based on various advanced stats.
Currently, stats used are from the days before the 2024 tournament.
Users can see team comparisons when hovering bracket slots.
Use the Randomize button to create a randomized bracket.
Click a filled bracket slot to advance the team, or an unfilled one to randomly select one of the previous teams based on stats.
Brackets can be saved to a database using the buttons at the top.
